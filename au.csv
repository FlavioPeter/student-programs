<p style=""text-align:justify""><b>Course Overview (MLC High School Preparation):</b>
Melbourne Language Centre’s English for Secondary Schools is considered to be the premier course of its kind in Victoria. The curriculum recognises the dual need for students to develop their general English language skills while also preparing them for future study in Australian high schools.

The focus of the morning class sessions is on English language and communication, and students are grouped by their English proficiency. In the afternoon classes, the students explore academic language pertaining to the Australian curriculum. Students are grouped by their year level in school in the afternoon, and they normally have a different teacher.

Specialist teachers are employed to teach mathematics and science, with students introduced to the concepts they can expect to study at their future schools. Homework is an integral part of the student program and is monitored by the classroom teacher on a daily basis. Excursions are organised regularly and include a range of cultural and social activities such as visits to museums, sightseeing tours, day hikes, sports days and BBQs.</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify""><b>Course Overview (MLC Junior School Preparation):</b>
Melbourne Language Centre’s English for Junior Schools is specifically designed to prepare young children to transition into Australian schools. It is also suitable for children who aim to learn English or improve their English language and communication skills.

This course offers comprehensive, engaging and student-centred classes with high-quality resources that enrich the learning environment and facilitate language acquisition. Class sizes are kept small to ensure every student gets individual support from teachers.</p>","[{'type': 'sectionHeader', 'value': 'Academic Background'}, {'type': 'cardSection', 'value': [{'type': 'card', 'value': [{'type': 'caption', 'value': 'Minimum Level of Education Completed'}, {'type': 'title', 'value': 'Grade 8'}]}, {'type': 'card', 'value': [{'type': 'caption', 'value': 'Minimum GPA'}, {'type': 'title', 'value': '0.0%'}]}]}]","{'id': '1670', 'name': 'Melbourne Language Centre', 'slug': 'melbourne-language-centre', 'location': 'Melbourne, Victoria, AU', 'logo': 'https://photos.applyboard.com/schools/000/001/670/logos/small/circle-cropped_%285%29.png?1604327490', 'countryCode': 'AU', 'headerImage': None}"
